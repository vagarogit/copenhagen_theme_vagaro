# Add Radix Navigation Menu

Run this command to add Radix Navigation to your project:

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-navigation-menu
# or
yarn add @radix-ui/react-navigation-menu
```

## Benefits of Using Radix Navigation

1. **Accessibility**: Built-in ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
2. **Smooth Animations**: Native support for enter/exit animations
3. **Focus Management**: Automatic focus handling for keyboard users
4. **Collision Detection**: Smart positioning to avoid viewport edges
5. **Composable**: Easy to customize styling while keeping functionality
6. **TypeScript Support**: Full TypeScript support out of the box

## Current vs Radix Comparison

### Current Implementation Issues:
- Manual event management (mouseenter/mouseleave)
- Custom positioning calculations
- No built-in accessibility features
- Complex animation handling
- Manual focus management

### Radix Navigation Benefits:
- Automatic event handling
- Built-in collision detection
- Accessibility by default
- Smooth animations with CSS or Framer Motion
- Focus management included
- Much less code to maintain

## Implementation Options

### Option 1: Replace Entire Navigation (Recommended)
Convert your header navigation to use Radix Navigation Menu components

### Option 2: Hybrid Approach
Keep your current HTML structure but replace the JavaScript logic with Radix

### Option 3: Gradual Migration
Migrate one dropdown at a time (start with Business Types, then Features)
